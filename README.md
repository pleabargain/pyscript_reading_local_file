# pyscript_reading_local_file
pyscript loading a local text file. Make sure you have your own local web server running for this to work. 
I'm using VS code and live server extension.

The question is why do we have to run a local server? Pyscript is supposed to be standalone... it's probably a security thing. 

Letting an HTML page run arbitrary internal code on a user's machine is bad.
